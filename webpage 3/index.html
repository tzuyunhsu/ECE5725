                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We separated the design and testing into the hardware (LED cube
                        construction and Arduino control) and software (music processing, music visualization, and
                        Raspberry Pi and mobile phone control) parts. The design concept is to perform real-time music
                        analysis visualization on the cube, and to provide user-friendly control between the mobile
                        interface and the LED cube. We also need to minimize the pins that are used by the LEDs to
                        realize the hardware buildup, and this helps enhance the performance of the music analysis
                        process.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Hardware Design</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">To control 216 RGB LEDs separately, we inevitably need to implement
                        multiplexing to achieve full control of the device in a limited amount of pins. Our original
                        plan is to use multiplexers to control all LEDs based on the reference of the previous student
                        work[1]. However, we need more than 14 pins (the total pins they used to control 512
                        single-colored LEDs) for our RGB LEDs, which may be impossible to fit on an Arduino Uno, not
                        even an Arduino Mega. Thus, we chose to use shift registers instead since they can be
                        daisy-chained to control more than eight output pins with three inputs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>LED cube construction</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px"> We used common cathode(-) RGB LEDs to build up the whole cube. For each
                        horizontal plane, which is also called a layer, the cathodes of the 36 LEDs are connected
                        together to ground. First, we soldered six layers of 6x6 LED planes separately, and then
                        inserted the wires of the desired length into the holes cut off on the base plane. Those wires
                        are the pillars to connect each LED in the same column of each plane together and to stabilize
                        the structure. Each LED has three wires connected to red, green, and blue signals. The most
                        important part is to make sure no LED connection is shorted in the soldering process.
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img style="width:300px" src="./img/t2.jpg" alt="">
                        <img style="width:225px" src="./img/t3.jpg" alt="">

                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Electronics</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px"> As mentioned above, the ground pins of each LED on the same plane are
                        connected together, and it is controlled by one N-channel MOSFET. The MOSFET is connected to an
                        output pin on a shift register, so the first shift register records the data to ground each
                        layer separately. As for the input signal of the LEDs, we only implement the green signal in the
                        current situation due to the time limit of this project. The wire of each green input signal of
                        an LED column is soldered to a wire, and the wire would be an output pin on a shift register.
                        Since we have 36 LED columns, we need 5 shift registers (8 output pins per each) to control all
                        of them. Shift registers can be connected to one another by the output enable pin (pin 9) with
                        the same clock signal. Thus, we chained the first shift register with the rest of them to
                        control all of the pins with only three digital pins on the Arduino.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Process and Testing</h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">To better understand multiplexing, we first tried to control a 3x3 LED
                        array by six digital pins (3 inputs for each row and 3 outputs for each column).
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-center"><img width="40%" src="./img/t1.jpg" alt=""></div>
                    <br>

                
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Then, when we moved on to change our design to utilize shift registers, we tested the basic
                        control of 8 LEDs in one shift register before chaining all six of them together. Originally, we
                        planned to connect the shift register controlling the ground of each layer to a separate set of
                        pins. However, after seeing another reference[2] showing the feasibility to control all signal
                        data altogether, we chained all six shift registers together for the process. The only thing we
                        need to remember is the data sequence of each output pin to send out the right signal. Overall,
                        the decision to implement the electronics of one color first instead of building all three
                        colors helps a lot in the building and debugging process, and it also saves a lot of time to
                        have a functioning prototype by the deadline.</p>

                    <h3>Software Design</h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">The software for the music visualizer setup consisted of python packages
                        such as Pandas, Librosa, BlueALSA, FIFO and serial.

                        We divided the software design into parts: music processing, music visualizer, playback control,
                        and player & serial communication.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Music Processing
                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We firstly designed to set up a real-time audio analyzer as we play the
                        music. However, we wanted the system to be controlled by mobile phones. To achieve that, it was
                        necessary to be equipped with a sound card or microphone. In the end, we adopted a concise way.
                        We made the music playing and music analyzing separately, which means there is no need for us to
                        collect the real-time music signal. We download the music file in mp3 format, and save the
                        preprocessing file for the purpose of reading it while the mobile phone plays the music.

                        After we got the mp3 file, we analyzed the music by Librosa and transformed it to the spectrom.




                    </p>
                    <div class="text-center"><img class='center' src="./img/spectrogram.png" alt=""></div>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">Since we have a 6*6*6 cube, we designed to divide the spectrogram into
                        six pieces. For
                        convenience, we selected six frequencies from the spectrogram range from 100 to 8000. Then we
                        extract the loudness level of these frequencies by time, the result would be a matrix. we saved
                        the matrix in csv by Pandas for the purpose of reading while music playing.</p>
                    <h4>Music Visualizer
                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We designed a class to read the music data. Before we generate the audio
                        analyzer, we need to define the name of the music for the program to find the required folder
                        whose name is the current playing music.

                        We will call some functions in the class later, while the music is playing. For example, we want
                        to know the decibel of the time T and the first frequency F. We input the two parameters of the
                        get_decibel function, the return value would be the decibel of the specified time and frequency.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Playback Control
                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">In this part, we played the music on the mobile phone, and the bluetooth
                        transmitted the audio to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi received streamed audio from the
                        A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) protocol, we referred most of the script from
                        https://scribles.net/controlling-bluetooth-audio-on-raspberry-pi/#Ref01. Before we followed the
                        instructions, we were required to enable Audio Profile Sink Role and pair the mobile phone with
                        Raspberry Pi 4. Here is the
                        link:https://scribles.net/streaming-bluetooth-audio-from-phone-to-raspberry-pi-using-alsa/.
                        After pairing the devices, the key point was to capture the audio streams from Bluetooth devices
                        and play them on Raspberry Pi 4. The bluez-alsa-utils helped to do that. After we install
                        Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend on internet, we simply run the script on terminal:
                        “bluealsa-aplay 00:00:00:00:00:00” and test whether the speaker made sounds as the mobile phone
                        was playing the music.

                        After it works, we run the code from the instructions and see some of the information of the
                        music playing.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">The first, third and fifth lines were the control commands from the
                        terminal. The rest of the lines showed the information of the music while the playing status
                        changed. Since there has been a special loop calledGLib Main loop, we were unable to take any
                        extra actions in the main program. We decided to modify the program to send messages to the
                        other program using FIFO for the purpose of communication with different programs.
                        Since we need to send the information of the playing status to the other python program.
                        We applied os.mkfifo to create a fifo file when the program detected the status change.
                        Meanwhile, the other program (main program) kept reading the fifo file if it existed. When we
                        followed the method, we found that the two programs did not continue until both the programs
                        finished the read/write operations. However, as long as the while loop does not stop, the read
                        operation would not stop, the programs would be stuck. To solve the problem, we just simply made
                        the FIFO file deleted after reading. Then when the status changed, the message sender created a
                        new FIFO to send to the main program.

                    <h4>Player & Serial communication </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">For this part, we need to combine all the above programs to calculate the
                        correct output of the cube lights, and send the messages to Arduino via serial.

                    <h5>Time Computing</h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">The basic idea for the calculation was:

                        Each time we press the pause and continue button, the main program will get the message from
                        FIFO, we can then update the playing time by the message. In addition, when the music changes,
                        it will also receive the name of new music. Therefore, we designed a loop to keep asking the
                        information from the FIFO, and if there is no update, then the program will compute the playing
                        time by itself. The basic idea for computing the time is every time it comes to the line
                        mentioned, it will add playtime to the difference of current time and last time. And then it
                        saves the current time as the last time for the preparation of the next computing.

                    </h5>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px">
                        In the serial communication, we applied a serial package which actually communicates with Arduino by UART.  It is called Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, and the method is widely used by the communications between Raspberry Pi and Arduino. After connect Arduino to Raspberry Pi by USB, we run the code in python:
                        </p>
                        <kbd>ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 9600, timeout=1)</kbd>
                        <br><br>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px">If there is no error, it shows the system has detected the device and the device is ready to transmit the data. Noted that UART can only transmit data in bytes, we transformed the data to bytes by python command
                        </p>
                        <kbd>command = bytes(out_str, 'utf-8') </kbd>
                        <br>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px">We also found a problem when we tried to implement the method. The data transmission would be slower after the music playing for around 30 seconds. The reason why it became slower was that the buffer has been full and it should pop out each element when new data came in, which dramatically reduced the transmission speed. To solve the problem, we reset the input and output buffer every time before we wrote the data to the serial.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px">We achieved part of our objectives to make music accessible through
                        senses other than hearing. Now, we can feel the high and low of music through the flashing LEDs.
                        The hardest resection that we encountered is to make real-time music frequency analysis be
                        displayed on the cube. We found out it’s almost impossible to achieve if we don’t have a
                        microphone on Raspberry Pi to read the music while it’s playing on the speaker. Even if we have
                        a microphone, the time delay between the analysis and the data transmission to the cube would
                        make the visualizer seem not synchronized to the music. Thus, we currently can only play several
                        pre-analyzed songs to display the patterns on the cube, and this approach is the closest method
                        we can achieve for real-time analysis at this stage.
